            THE WORLD'S FIRST ALL-ELECTRIC SUPERTRUCKS GMC HUMMER SUV
        </h1>

        <p>
            The HummerEV has Super Cruise hands-free driving assist, an adaptive air suspension, four-wheel steering, and 
            extras such as Extract and Crab Walk modes to get out of dicey situations on the trail. There is a ferocious launch 
            control sequence known as Watts to Freedom—or WTF—and with three motors, the top-trim Hummers generate 830 horsepower 
            and about 1,045 lb-ft of torque, enough to blast from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. Over time, more affordable models will 
            be added with one fewer motor, less power, lower range, and fewer features.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>ESTIMATED PRICE:</strong> The Edition 1 starts at $105,595. The rest of the lineup will launch by spring 2024 at prices ranging from $79,995 to $99,995.
